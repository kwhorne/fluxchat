- Node.js & NPM (for asset compilation)

## Installation

### 1. Install the Package

```bash
composer require kwhorne/fluxchat
```

### 2. Run the Installation Command

```bash
php artisan fluxchat:install
```

**The following actions will be executed:**
- Publish configuration file
- Publish migration files
- Create a storage symlink

### 3. Enable UUIDs (Optional)

If you want FluxChat to use UUIDs instead of auto-incrementing integers for conversations, update the config before running migrations:

```php
// config/fluxchat.php
'uuids' => true,
```

### 4. Run Migrations

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

## Configuration

### Step 1: Enable Broadcasting

In newer Laravel installations, broadcasting is disabled by default. To enable it, run:

```bash
php artisan install:broadcasting
```

> **Note:** This command will prompt you to install Laravel Reverb and necessary front-end packages such as Echo. Accept if you don't yet have a WebSocket server set up.

Then, start your Reverb server:

```bash
php artisan reverb:start
```

For more details, refer to the [Laravel Broadcasting Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting), including information on integrating Laravel Echo for real-time updates.

### Step 2: Start Your Queue Worker

After configuring broadcasting, start a queue worker to handle message broadcasting and other queued tasks:

```bash
php artisan queue:work --queue=messages,default
```

> **Queue Prioritization:** The `messages` queue is prioritized to ensure real-time message delivery.

### Step 3: Start Development Server

To start your development server, run:

```bash
composer run dev
```

If you're not running the latest Laravel version, you can run these commands separately:

```bash
php artisan serve
npm run dev
```

## Customization

### Publishing Translations

If you need to customize the language files, you can publish them using:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=fluxchat-translations
```

Available languages:
- English (`en`)
- Norwegian Bokm√•l (`nb`)

### Publishing Views

To modify FluxChat's Blade views, publish them with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=fluxchat-views
